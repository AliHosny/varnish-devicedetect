Device detection in Varnish
===========================

The goal of this VCL set is to provide a simple & easy way of getting
device detection going in Varnish. (http://www.varnish-cache.org)

Specific problems that should be adressed:
* desktop versions get the usual page.
* mobile clients should get the tiny version.
* ipad users should get a tablet-adjusted page.
